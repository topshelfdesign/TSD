	<div class="medium-6 columns">
		<p class="intro">It all began at a kitchen table. Thatâ€™s where a talented designer and two entrepreneurs who dreamed of creating a graphic design firm that exceeded the industry standard for quality and customer experience formed Top Shelf Design, LLC. Nearly a decade later, our company has completed over 6,000 projects for more than 3,100 clients. Owners Brendan and Kathryn Kiel, Creative Director Gena Romano, and a staff of highly creative and dedicated designers, developers, and account managers continue to keep true to the vision established in 2004.  Headquartered in the Rosslyn neighborhood of Arlington, we are now respected through the greater Washington DC region, Raleigh, and Atlanta as a leader in web design and graphic design. And the kitchen table is still in our studio to remind us of our beginnings.
